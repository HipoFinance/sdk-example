# Hipo SDK Usage Example

Hipo is a decentralized, permission-less, open-source liquid staking protocol on TON blockchain. Visit [Hipo.Finance](https://hipo.finance) for more information or read the [docs](https://docs.hipo.finance).

This is an example web application that uses the Hipo [SDK](https://github.com/HipoFinance/sdk) to help users in staking and unstaking. This is effectively a slimmed down version of Hipo [webapp](https://github.com/HipoFinance/webapp) to make it easier for you to integrate with Hipo.

You can browse the deployed version at [sdk-example.hipo.finance](https://sdk-example.hipo.finance).
